Feeling the Future: Augmenting Medicine with Relocated Haptic Feedback in Extended Reality Environments

 

<p><b> Talk Description </b></p>

Extended reality, encompassing virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and everything in between, offers promising opportunities across various fields, including medicine and healthcare. Traditional medical training methods rely on expensive and often limited models, or direct practice on patients, posing ethical and safety concerns. Medical simulations in virtual environments provide a safer and more flexible alternative, allowing trainees to practice with virtual or “mixed reality” patients and receive feedback on their interactions. However, the absence of haptic feedback hampers the immersive experience. Wearable haptic devices can enhance realism and training effectiveness. By relocating haptic feedback from the fingertips to the wrist, trainees can interact with physical tools while receiving supplemental haptic feedback, improving realism and enabling unencumbered interactions with tools and patients. This talk will explore the importance of relocated haptic feedback in medical training, and its applications to enhance realism and facilitate skill refinement in extended reality environments.
 

<p><b> Speaker Bio </b></p>

Jasmin holds an SB in Mechanical Engineering from MIT and an MS in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University. She is currently working on her Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the Collaborative Haptics and Robotics in Medicine (CHARM) Lab under Prof. Allison Okamura. Jasmin’s research focus is on relocated haptic feedback for wrist-worn tactile displays, aiming to optimize haptic relocation from fingertips to wrist for virtual interactions. Ultimately, she seeks to inform design decisions for wearable haptic devices and haptic rendering cues in extended reality environments.
