<p><b> Talk Title </b></p>

Soft Wearable Robot for Improving Mobility in Individuals with Parkinson’s Disease

<p><b> Talk Description </b></p>

Freezing of gait (FoG) is a profoundly disruptive phenomenon that significantly hastens disability in individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Described as a feeling of feet getting glued to the floor, this paroxysmal motor disturbance halts walking against one’s intention. While there are a range of therapies attempting to manage FoG, the benefits are modest and transient, resulting in a lack of effective treatments. In this presentation, I will introduce a soft hip flexion exosuit that has the potential to avert FoG in PD. 

 

<p><b> Speaker Bio </b></p>

Dr. Jinsoo Kim earned his B.S. and M.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Seoul National University (SNU). He then pursued his graduate studies at Harvard University, where he completed his Ph.D. and S.M. in Engineering Sciences. Following this, he served as a postdoctoral scholar in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University. He is now an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at SNU. His research focuses on enhancing mobility using wearable robots for both healthy individuals and those with gait disabilities.
