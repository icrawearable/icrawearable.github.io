MAESTRO: Multi-sensed AI Environment for Surgical Task and Role Optimisation

<p><b> Talk Description </b></p>

A fitting analogy for the modern operating theatre is that of a multiverse formed by a cluster of smaller universes: those of patient, multidisciplinary surgical team and operative environment. If we wish to fully appreciate all aspects governing surgical performance, in and around the operating theatre, we need to adopt a holistic approach and consider all universes in parallel. Inspired by the dichotomy between classic and quantum physics, we postulate that events/ripples in one universe can be detected in other parallel universes. This approach unifies the human, the physical, and digital entities which are present in the operating theatre under a single framework. The MAESTRO vision aims to lay the foundations for the operating theatre of the future; a surgical environment powered by trustable, human-understanding artificial intelligence able to continually adapt and learn the best way to optimise safety, efficacy, teamwork, economy, and clinical outcomes. One could think of MAESTRO as being analogous to an orchestra conductor, overseeing a team working towards a common goal together, in unison.
