<p><b> Talk Title </b></p>

From Clinics to Homes: Assessing Disease and Health with Everyday Devices

 

<p><b> Talk Description </b></p>

Today's clinical systems frequently exhibit delayed diagnoses, sporadic patient visits, and unequal access to care. Can we identify chronic diseases earlier, potentially before they manifest clinically? Furthermore, can we bring comprehensive medical assessments into patient’s own homes to ensure accessible care for all? In this talk, I will present machine learning methods to bridge these gaps with everyday sensors. I will first introduce an AI-powered digital biomarker that detects Parkinson’s disease multiple years before clinical diagnosis, using just nocturnal breathing signals. I will then discuss algorithms for contactless measurement of human vital signs using smartphones. Finally, I will discuss the potential of AI to realize passive, longitudinal, and in-home tracking of disease severity, progression, and medication response.
