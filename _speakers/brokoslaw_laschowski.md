Robotic Leg Control: From Artificial Intelligence to Brain-Machine Interfaces 

<p><b> Talk Description </b></p>

One of the grand challenges in human locomotion with robotic prosthetic legs and exoskeletons is control - i.e., how should the robot walk? In this talk, Dr. Laschowski will present his latest research on robotic leg control, ranging from autonomous control using computer vision and/or reinforcement learning to neural control using brain-machine interfaces. One of the long-term goals of his research is to conduct the first experiments to study, along this spectrum of autonomy, what level of control do individual users prefer, which remains one of the major unsolved research questions in the field.
