Robotic Leg Control: From Artificial Intelligence to Brain-Machine Interfaces 

<p><b> Talk Description </b></p>

One of the grand challenges in human locomotion with robotic prosthetic legs and exoskeletons is control - i.e., how should the robot walk? In this talk, Dr. Laschowski will present his latest research on robotic leg control, ranging from autonomous control using computer vision and/or reinforcement learning to neural control using brain-machine interfaces. One of the long-term goals of his research is to conduct the first experiments to study, along this spectrum of autonomy, what level of control do individual users prefer, which remains one of the major unsolved research questions in the field.

 

<p><b> Speaker Bio </b></p>

Dr. Brok Laschowski is a Research Scientist and Principal Investigator with the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in Rehabilitation Team at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Canada’s largest rehabilitation hospital, and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. He also works as a Core Faculty Member in the University of Toronto Robotics Institute, where he leads the Neural Robotics Lab. His fields of expertise include machine learning, computer vision, neural networks (biological and artificial), human-robot interaction, reinforcement learning, computational neuroscience, deep learning, and brain-machine interfaces. Overall, his research aims to improve health and performance by integrating humans with robotics and artificial intelligence.
