Aria Glasses: An open-science wearable device for egocentric multi-modal AI research

 

<p><b> Talk Description </b></p>

Augmented reality (AR) glasses will profoundly re-shape how we design assistive AI technolgoies, including healthcare robotics, by harnessing human experience and training powerful AI models using egocentric data sources. We introduce Aria, the all-day wearable, socially acceptable form-factor glasses to support always available, context-aware and personalized AI applications. Its industry-leading hardware specs, multi-modal data recording and streaming features, along with open-source software, datasets and community, make Aria the go-to platform for egocentric AI research and are quickly accelerating this emerging research field. In this talk, I will give an overview of the Aria ecosystem, recent advances in state-of-the-art egocentric machine perception, available open-source Aria software tools, as well as discussing the challenges and opportunities related to wearable/healthcare robotics research.
